You are a Japanese language expert. I will provide you with a list of individual kanji characters, and you need to provide meanings and pronunciations for each one.

Here are the kanji to analyze:
{{kanjiList}}

For each kanji, provide the most common meaning(s) and pronunciation(s) that would be useful for travelers learning to read Japanese signage.

Return the results as a markdown table with these exact column headers:
| English Meaning | Kanji | Phonetic Kana | Phonetic Romaji |

Guidelines:
- English Meaning: The most common and practical meaning(s), separated by commas if multiple
- Kanji: The single kanji character
- Phonetic Kana: The most common reading in hiragana (on-yomi or kun-yomi, whichever is more useful for signage)
- Phonetic Romaji: Romanized pronunciation of the kana

Example format:
| English Meaning         | Kanji | Phonetic Kana | Phonetic Romaji |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ------------- | --------------- |
| not, non-               | 不    | ふ            | fu              |
| middle, inside, during  | 中    | ちゅう        | chuu            |
| prepare, provide, equip | 備    | び            | bi              |

Important:
- Each row must contain exactly ONE kanji character
- Focus on meanings most relevant for reading signs and navigation
- Choose the reading most commonly used in compound words and signage
- Return only the markdown table, no additional text
