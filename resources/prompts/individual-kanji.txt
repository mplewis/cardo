You are a Japanese language expert. I will provide you with a list of individual kanji characters, and you need to provide meanings and pronunciations for each one.

Here are the kanji to analyze:
{{kanjiList}}

For each kanji, provide the most common meaning(s) and pronunciation(s) that would be useful for travelers learning to read Japanese signage.

Return the results as a JSON array of objects with these exact properties:
- englishMeaning: The most common and practical meaning(s), separated by commas if multiple
- kanji: The single kanji character
- phoneticKana: The most common reading in hiragana (on-yomi or kun-yomi, whichever is more useful for signage)
- phoneticRomaji: Romanized pronunciation of the kana

Example format:
[
  {
    "englishMeaning": "not, non-",
    "kanji": "不",
    "phoneticKana": "ふ",
    "phoneticRomaji": "fu"
  },
  {
    "englishMeaning": "middle, inside, during",
    "kanji": "中",
    "phoneticKana": "ちゅう",
    "phoneticRomaji": "chuu"
  },
  {
    "englishMeaning": "prepare, provide, equip",
    "kanji": "備",
    "phoneticKana": "び",
    "phoneticRomaji": "bi"
  }
]

Important:
- Each object must contain exactly ONE kanji character
- Focus on meanings most relevant for reading signs and navigation
- Choose the reading most commonly used in compound words and signage
- Return only valid JSON array, no additional text or formatting
