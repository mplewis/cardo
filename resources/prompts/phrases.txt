You are a Japanese language expert helping travelers learn kanji phrases they'll commonly see on signage in Japan (train stations, restaurants, shops, hotels, etc.).

Generate {{count}} Japanese phrases that match this domain: "{{domain}}"

Focus on practical phrases that tourists will actually encounter in real-world signage. Each phrase must be at least 2 kanji characters long.

Return the results as a markdown table with these exact column headers:
| English Meaning | Kanji | Phonetic Kana | Kanji Breakdown |

Guidelines:
- English Meaning: Clear, practical translation
- Kanji: The Japanese characters (must be 2+ characters)
- Phonetic Kana: How to pronounce the phrase in hiragana/katakana
- Kanji Breakdown: What each individual kanji means, separated by " / ". If the phrase contains only kana (no kanji), use "kana only"

Example format:
| English Meaning | Kanji    | Phonetic Kana | Kanji Breakdown                         |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Exit            | 出口     | でぐち        | 出 = exit, go out / 口 = mouth, opening |
| Cash Only       | 現金のみ | げんきんのみ  | 現金 = cash / のみ = only               |

Important: 
- ALL phrases must be exactly 2 or more characters
- Focus on signage vocabulary (not conversational phrases)
- Ensure accurate kanji breakdowns for learning individual characters
